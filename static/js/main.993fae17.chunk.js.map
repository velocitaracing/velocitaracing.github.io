At that time, entrepreneur and engineer Cliff Garrett led a project team to develop a turbocharger for a Caterpillar D9 crawler tractor, marking the beginning of the turbocharged era for the automotive industry. Garrett technologies and innovations have been used by nearly every major global auto maker, resulting in approximately 100 million vehicles with our products and an average launch rate of 100 new applications annually spanning, gas, diesel, natural gas, electric and fuel cell powertrains. The story of turbo begins in 1954 when Garrett’s T15 turbo was paired with Caterpillar’s D9 crawler. Although the appropriately named Oldsmobile Jetfire Turbo Rocket became the first turbocharged production car in 1962, the technology’s impact was initially felt more keenly in commercial vehicles when in 1967 Deere selected the Garrett T04 turbo for its farm tractor range…and the entire industry followed. But it was in the 1990s that turbo went mainstream and global, when Garrett’s new variable nozzle turbine technology (VNT) enabled the 1991 Fiat Croma to adjust exhaust gas flow in direct response to specific engine requirements. And when Volkswagen-Audi paired VNT technology with its 1.9L diesel engine for its Frankfurt Motor Show launch in 1995, the symbiotic fit between turbocharging and direct injection diesel powertrains was confirmed…and evolution became revolution. Our highly-engineered technologies are rooted in more than 60-years of pioneering turbocharging systems for gasoline and diesel, but today we go further. Our world-class technical solutions are helping to drive a new era in hybrid electrification and fuel-cell powertrains. These innovations enable our customers to set new benchmarks in vehicle performance while addressing evolving fuel efficiency and exhaust emissions regulations. We’re also ready for the connected and autonomous vehicle era, with cybersecurity and prognostic software systems that create a secure and safe operating environment.',\r\n        web:

       This team comprises of 35 passionate and enthusiastic\r\n              undergraduate students from various departments, who are\r\n              continuously working on the development of racing grade vehicles\r\n              for various competitions across India. The racing platforms such\r\n              as Formula Bharat has given our students a chance to explore\r\n              various engineering practices which play a vital role in the\r\n              development of our country. Our finish line is more than just a\r\n              place on the track; our mission is and has always been to\r\n              innovate, to broaden the frontiers of young professionals through\r\n              their creativity, ingenuity, and dexterity.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              Came to life around a small table at the MSRIT canteen, where a\r\n              group of students from the first year found themselves in the\r\n              midst of fellow automobile enthusiasts. Since then, we’ve come a\r\n              long way. Having designed and fabricated a race kart while we were\r\n              still freshers, we came among the top teams in the country. This\r\n              year, we have divided ourselves into 2 subdivisions. One,consists\r\n              of a team entirely focused on National level competitions. The\r\n              second division consists of a senior team working on PROJECT\r\n              SURGE- a project aimed at designing cars of the future.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br
