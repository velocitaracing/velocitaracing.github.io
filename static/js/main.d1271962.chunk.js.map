       This team comprises of 35 passionate and enthusiastic\r\n              undergraduate students from various departments, who are\r\n              continuously working on the development of racing grade vehicles\r\n              for various competitions across India. The racing platforms such\r\n              as Formula Bharat has given our students a chance to explore\r\n              various engineering practices which play a vital role in the\r\n              development of our country. Our finish line is more than just a\r\n              place on the track; our mission is and has always been to\r\n              innovate, to broaden the frontiers of young professionals through\r\n              their creativity, ingenuity, and dexterity.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              Came to life around a small table at the MSRIT canteen, where a\r\n              group of students from the first year found themselves in the\r\n              midst of fellow automobile enthusiasts. Since then, we’ve come a\r\n              long way. Having designed and fabricated a race kart while we were\r\n              still freshers, we came among the top teams in the country. This\r\n              year, we have divided ourselves into 2 subdivisions. One,consists\r\n              of a team entirely focused on National level competitions. The\r\n              second division consists of a senior team working on PROJECT\r\n              SURGE- a project aimed at designing cars of the future.\r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              Having taken its baby steps to becoming a startup, Velocita is on\r\n              the look out for beneficiaries and sponsors for our projects.\r\n            </Typography>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n      </ThemeProvider>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/satvik.96d26c20.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/boss.38f17bbb.jfif\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/soumyadeep.ee4538ad.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/rijul.83191d68.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/karthik.2bb7ab64.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/vachan.1ec36f14.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sandesh.9be6df0c.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/shreyas.4b0456c2.JPG\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/vaibhav.4b547c54.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/saikrishna.aeb22f62.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/tejas.cc56908a.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/hariabhijit.0e8c64a9.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/chiranjeevi.d1854c52.jpg\";","import Satvik from \"../../assets/Team/satvik.png\"\r\nimport Niranjan from \"../../assets/Team/boss.jfif\"\r\nimport Deep from \"../../assets/Team/soumyadeep.jpg\"\r\nimport Rijul from \"../../assets/Team/rijul.png\"\r\nimport Karthik from \"../../assets/Team/karthik.jpeg\"\r\nimport Sanjeev from \"../../assets/Team/sanjeev.jpg\"\r\nimport Abhinav from \"../../assets/Team/abhinav.jpg\"\r\nimport Amar from \"../../assets/Team/amar.jpeg\"\r\nimport Vachan from \"../../assets/Team/vachan.jpg\"\r\nimport Sandesh from \"../../assets/Team/sandesh.jpeg\"\r\nimport Shreyas from \"../../assets/Team/shreyas.JPG\"\r\nimport Vaibhav from \"../../assets/Team/vaibhav.jpg\"\r\nimport Saikrishna from \"../../assets/Team/saikrishna.jpeg\"\r\nimport Keertith from \"../../assets/Team/keertith.jpeg\"\r\n\r\nimport Tejas from \"../../assets/Team/tejas.jpeg\"\r\nimport HariAbhijit from \"../../assets/Team/hariabhijit.jpg\"\r\nimport Chiranjeevi from \"../../assets/Team/chiranjeevi.jpg\"\r\nimport Abdul from \"../../assets/Team/abdul.jpg\"\r\nimport Kishore from \"../../assets/Team/kishore.jpg\"\r\nimport Nagarjun from \"../../assets/Team/nagarjun.jpg\"\r\nimport KarthikRakesh from \"../../assets/Team/rakesh.jpeg\"\r\nimport KarthikGowda from \"../../assets/Team/gowda.JPG\"\r\nimport Sumukh from \"../../assets/Team/sumukh.jpg\"\r\nimport Neelay from \"../../assets/Team/unde.jpg\"\r\nimport Sanskar from \"../../assets/Team/sanskar.jpg\"\r\nimport Abhishek from \"../../assets/Team/biscuit.jpg\"\r\n\r\n\r\nexport const Members = [\r\n    {\r\n        id: '2021',\r\n        teamMembers:[\r\n\r\n            {\r\n                id: 'A0',\r\n                name: 'Niranjan Bharadwaj',\r\n                image: Niranjan,\r\n                role: 'Team Captain',\r\n\r\n                intro: '',\r\n                about: '',\r\n\r\n                linkedIn: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/niranjan-bharadwaj-2339021a5/',\r\n                emailId: 'mailto:niranjan.bharadwaj11@gmail.com',\r\n            },\r\n\r\n            {\r\n                id: 'A1',\r\n                name: 'Sanjeev Kumar S',\r\n                image: Sanjeev,\r\n                role: 'Team manager',\r\n\r\n                intro: '\"The Realist!\"',\r\n                about: '',\r\n\r\n                linkedIn: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjeev-kumar-s1899/',\r\n                emailId: 'mailto:sanjuraju43@gmail.com',\r\n            },\r\n\r\n            {\r\n                id: 'A2',\r\n                name: 'Vaibhav Harinarayan',\r\n                image: Vaibhav,\r\n                role: 'Vice Captain',\r\n\r\n                intro: '\"Think - Innovate - Design - Fabricate\"',\r\n                about: '',\r\n\r\n                linkedIn: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhav-harinarayan-232455135',\r\n                emailId: 'mailto:vaibhavharinarayan@gmail.com',\r\n            },\r\n\r\n            {\r\n                id: 'A3',\r\n                name: 'Satvik S',\r\n                image: Satvik,\r\n                role: 'Vice Captain',\r\n                intro: '\"Desire is the engine of creation.\"',\r\n                about: 'I am a creative and motivated problem solver.
